        <p>The final work period is done and the application is up and running at <a href="https://snd96.pythonanywhere.com/">https://snd96.pythonanywhere.com/</a>. The github repository for my work can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/SND96/twine-stories">https://github.com/SND96/twine-stories</a>.</p>

<p>These are the tasks that the application can so far perform.
* Parse through an entire Twine story and then extract the relevant data like questions and choice statements. The entire story can then be navigated using Flask.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Generate the phonemes for each choice statement and then loading it into <a href="https://github.com/syl22-00/pocketsphinx.js">Pocketsphinx.js</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Uses the voice recording UI found in <a href="https://github.com/SND96/pocketsphinx-scores">https://github.com/SND96/pocketsphinx-scores</a>, to record the user&rsquo;s voice. The recording can then be replayed.</p></li>

<li><p>The recording can also be evaluated to see if it matches any of the choices in the Twine node. If it does, the application automatically navigates to the next node.</p></li>

<li><p>The application can also perform intelligibility remediation on the phrase &ldquo;we drank tea in the afternoon and watched tv&rdquo;. This node can be reached by clicking on the option &ldquo;Click for more pronunciation evaluation&rdquo; in the starting node of the story. The user can record their saying of the phrase and on pressing evaluate, the intelligibility scores for each word will be displayed.</p></li>

<li><p>Right now the voice recognition for choosing an option is still buggy and can result in wrong phrases being chosen.</p></li>

<li><p>Also the server for the intelligibility scores can be slow and doesn&rsquo;t respond for many minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Due to a lack of recordings only one phrase is available for intelligibility scoring.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The application as of now is ready to take in a new Twine story and convert it into a voice navigated story. I tried to do as much as I could to get it ready in time. I&rsquo;m happy with what I&rsquo;ve accomplished but still wish I could&rsquo;ve done more. For now, I&rsquo;m done with GSoC 2017 :D</p>
